### Updating vendor libraries

First ensure that you have installed [glide](https://glide.sh/), a dependency and vendor manager for go.

After you have glide installed, run `glide update`. For more information on how to use glide for adding 
dependencies, see the [glide documentation](https://glide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
